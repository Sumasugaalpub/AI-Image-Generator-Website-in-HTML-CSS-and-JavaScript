# AI Image Generator Website

## 📚 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an **AI Image Generator Website** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website allows users to generate AI-generated images and display them in a clean and user-friendly interface. Whether you prefer video tutorials or step-by-step guides, this project will help you create a fully functional website.

If you enjoy video tutorials, check out the accompanying **YouTube video**, where I explain each line of code with informative comments. Alternatively, you can follow this step-by-step guide to build your own AI image generator website and showcase it in your portfolio.

## 🚀 Features
- **User Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with a responsive layout.
- **AI Image Generation**: Allows users to generate and view AI-generated images.
- **Theme Customization**: Customize the look and feel using a dark/light theme toggle.
- **Image Showcase**: Display default or custom images on the website.

## 💻 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- A text editor such as **VS Code** or **Sublime Text**.
- A browser to view the website and test its functionality.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Steps to Build the AI Image Generator Website:

1. **Create Project Folder**:  
   Create a folder and name it anything you like for your project.

2. **Create the Necessary Files**:  
   Inside the project folder, create the following files:
   - `index.html` – Main HTML file for website structure.
   - `style.css` – CSS file to style the website.
   - `script.js` – JavaScript file to handle functionality.

3. **Download or Use Custom Images**:  
   - Download the **Images** folder and place it in your project directory. This folder contains default showcase images, but you can also use your own images if preferred.

4. **Add HTML Structure**:  
   Open the `index.html` file and add the necessary HTML markup. This includes essential tags such as `div`, `form`, `input`, `button`, and `image`, which will structure the layout of the website.

## 📝 Code Walkthrough

1. **index.html**:
